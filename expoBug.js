This error typically occurs when using Expo's `start` command and can manifest in several ways, often without immediately clear error messages.  The underlying issue usually relates to inconsistencies or problems in the project setup, especially regarding dependencies, build configurations, or environment variables. Sometimes, a seemingly unrelated change in your codebase (like adding a new package) will trigger this without directly causing the issue.   It's also possible this error can happen due to problems with the underlying environment, especially if Expo CLI is not properly configured or there are conflicts with other Node.js processes.
