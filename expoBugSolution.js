// Solution 1: Clean and Reinstall Dependencies
// This is often the most effective first step.
rm -rf node_modules && yarn install || npm install

// Solution 2: Check for Package.json Errors
// Make sure there are no typos in package names or version numbers in your `package.json`

// Solution 3: Examine Expo Configuration Files
// Check `app.json` and `expo.json` files for any missing or invalid configuration parameters.
// Look for typos, syntax errors, or any discrepancies between settings.

// Solution 4: Restart Your System
// Sometimes, a simple restart is sufficient to clear up conflicts with other processes.

// Solution 5: Check the Expo CLI version
// Ensure that you're running the latest version of Expo CLI: `expo upgrade`

// Solution 6: Test on a Different Machine or VM
// Try launching your project in a different environment to rule out environment-specific problems.

// Solution 7: Look for other Node.js processes
// Check your system for other Node.js processes running and terminate any unnecessary ones.

//Solution 8 (Advanced): Inspect system logs and error messages.
// On some OS, you might find clues in system error logs related to your project.
// This may help identifying a underlying problem not obvious directly from the Expo CLI output.
