# Expo CLI 'start' Command Failure: Non-Specific Errors

This repository demonstrates a common yet cryptic issue with the Expo CLI's `start` command. The problem manifests as a failure to launch the development server without providing clear error messages. This is often due to underlying issues within the project's configuration, dependencies, or the development environment itself.

## How to Reproduce

While precise reproduction steps aren't possible due to the error's non-specific nature, here's what often contributes:

* **Inconsistent Dependencies:** Version conflicts or missing dependencies are frequent culprits.
* **Incorrect Build Configuration:** Problems within `app.json` or `expo.json` can lead to failures.
* **Environment Variables:** Issues with environment variables can also trigger this.
* **Conflicting Node.js Processes:** Other processes might interfere with the Expo CLI.

## Potential Solutions

The provided solution file offers a few approaches to resolving the issue, including:

* **Cleaning the Project:** Removing `node_modules` and reinstalling packages.
* **Checking Package.json:** Verifying dependency versions and resolving conflicts.
* **Validating the Config Files:** Thoroughly reviewing `app.json` and `expo.json` for any syntax errors or inconsistencies.
* **Restarting your System:** In some instances, this might reset the environment enough to solve the problem.
